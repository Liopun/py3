My Python Learning Journey

## Practice Questions:

- [Character Input](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html) - Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
- [Odd or Even](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/02/05/02-odd-or-even.html) - Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2
