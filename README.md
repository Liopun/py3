My Python Learning Journey

In this Github repository, I'm documenting my journey by providing solutions to python questions that are available on the internet for beginners, so that you can follow along. Details about the questions are provided.

But not too much theory, I want this to be a practical journey so feel free to contribute an good examples you want to share!

Here are some practice questions I've done so far:

## Practice Questions:

- [#1 Character Input](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html) - Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old. [code](practice/char_input.py)
- [#2 Odd or Even](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/02/05/02-odd-or-even.html) - Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2. [code](practice/odd_even.py)
- [#3 List Less Than Ten](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/02/15/03-list-less-than-ten.html) - write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5. [code](practice/less_than_ten.py)
- [#4 Divisors](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/02/26/04-divisors.html) - Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder) [code](practice/divisors.py)
- [#5 List Overlap](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/05/05-list-overlap.html) - write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. [code](practice/list_overlap.py)
- [#6 String Lists](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/12/06-string-lists.html) - Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards) [code](practice/palindrome.py)
- [#7 List Comprehensions](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/19/07-list-comprehensions.html) - Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it. [code](practice/list_comprehensions.py)
- [#8 Rock Paper Scissors](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/26/08-rock-paper-scissors.html) - Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)
Remember the rules: Rock beats scissors, Scissors beats paper and Paper beats rock. [code](practice/rock_paper_scissors.py)
- [#9 Guessing Game One](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/04/02/09-guessing-game-one.html) - Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. [code](practice/guessing_game1.py)
- [#10 List Overlap Comprehensions](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/04/10/10-list-overlap-comprehensions.html) - Write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. Using at least one list comprehension. [code](practice/list_overlap_comprehensions.py)
