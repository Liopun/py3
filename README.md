My Python Learning Journey

## Practice Questions:

- [Character Input](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html) - Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
- [Odd or Even](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/02/05/02-odd-or-even.html) - Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2.
- [List Less Than Ten](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/02/15/03-list-less-than-ten.html) - write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
- [Divisors](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/02/26/04-divisors.html) - Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
- [List Overlap](http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/05/05-list-overlap.html) - write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
